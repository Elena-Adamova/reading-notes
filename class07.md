## Programming with JavaScript

1. ### What is control flow?

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

2. ### What is a JavaScript function?

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

3. ### What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

4. ### What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
