## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

1. ### What are variables in JavaScript?

**Variables** are Containers for Storing Data.

2. ### What does it mean to declare a variable?

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

3. ### What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

_In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

x = x + 5

In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)



4. ### What is information received from the user called?

The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
