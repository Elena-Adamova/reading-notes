## Operators and Loops

- ### What is an _expression_ in JavaScript?

An _expression_ is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

- ### Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

- ### When does a _for_ loop stop executing?

A _for_ loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

- ### How many times will a _while_ loop execute?

A _while_ statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
