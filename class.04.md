## Structure web pages with HTML

### 1. What is HTML and why do we use it?
- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

**HTML** is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

### 2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
1. The opening tag.
2. The closing tag.
3. The content.

The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

### 3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

- **Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

### 4. What is a semantic element?

- In programming, *Semantics* refers to the meaning of a piece of code.

In HTML, for example, the **h1** element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
