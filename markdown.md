# Some things about Markdown.

1. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

2. There are several reasons why people use Markdown:

    + Markdown can be used for everything.
    + Markdown is portable.
    + Markdown is platform independent.
    + Markdown is future proof.
    + Markdown is everywhere.

3. To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase.

    + # To create the largest heading you need to use one number sign (e.g., # My Header).

    + ###### To create the smallest heading you need to use six number signs (e.g., ###### My Header).

4. When making text **bold** for emphasis, it is best practice to use two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

    To *italicize* text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

5. To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [my GitHub profile page]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://github.com/Elena-Adamova)).

    The rendered output looks like this:

    There is [my GitHub profile page](https://github.com/elena-adamova).

6. To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.
