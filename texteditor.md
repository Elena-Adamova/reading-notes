## Class 02

### The Coder's Computer

### 1. Four important features to look for in a text editor:

- code completion;
-  syntax highlighting;
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue);
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

### 2. What do the following commands do:

1. The command **pwd** tells you what your current or present working directory is.

2. The command **ls** is for letting you know what is there.

3. The command **cd** is for changing directory.

4. The command **mkdir** is for making directory.

5. The command **touch** is for creating file.

### 3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

1. cd projects - changes dir to projects.
    
2. mkdir new-project - creates new folder under name new-project.

3. touch new-project/newfile.md - creates new file in new-project folder.

4. cd .. - changes path to one level (folder) back.

5. ls projects/new-project - shows what included in folder.
