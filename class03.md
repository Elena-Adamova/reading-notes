#### 1. What is Version Control?

> Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes.

#### 2. What is cloning in Git?

> By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

#### 3. What is the command to track and stage files?

> Files are tracked and staged for committing after using these commands:
>
> Track one file only by using the following format: **git add filename**
>
> Track all files in a repository by using the following command: __$ git add *__

#### 4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

> To undo changes resulting from a particular commit, use the __git revert__ command. This command appends a new commit that undoes changes introduced by a specific commit. This prevents Git from losing history.

#### 5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

> To push changes to Cithub use this command: __$ git push__
