## What is growth mindset?

_In my own words ***_growth mindset_*** is to be motivated to work to improve skills and to learn new things to make this way more interesting and productive._

### 3 reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:

+ Think about my goals like I've already achieved them

+ Get inspiration by other people

+ Speaking up when something isn't working and asking for support
